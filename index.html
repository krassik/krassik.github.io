    <ul>
      <li>Allows to search for high quality travel stories about beautiful places from travel blogs and other sources.
      <li>Finds outdoor adventures, historical sites, city life, kid-friendly activities, beautiful vistas and hidden spots.
      <li>Saves search results to a bucket list so you donâ€™t forget your next destination, and lets you share them with travel buddies.

        <p>Imagine exercise rouine unfolding as a story. In this particular example you could be joined by some Disney characters. No AR enabled hardware at my disposal for this project, hence worked arround this, self-implemented AR, not too spectacularly. Ideal for such application should be AR glasses accessory. </p>

        <h2>Multichannel Decoding for Mobile Devices</h1>
          <iframe width="560" height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ankJblpD5xc"></iframe>

          <p>In the days of the 32-bit ARM, this project was aiming to display a handful of video streams simultaneously on a mobile device screen similar to how CCTV stations are used to monitor arrays of security cameras.  Major constraint for this outcome had been the capability of the microprocessor for which the mobile operating systems restricted to one at a time, hence for decoding of single stream only. On this video I put to test the diversity of encoding schemes and container formats for the mobile devices. In the aftermath a solution circumventing the limitation was found and became cornerstone for successful product.</p>
