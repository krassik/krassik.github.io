  <p>The animation is controlled by the gyro which picks up the rotational motion.</p>

  <h2>Flight Simulation</h1>

    <p>Remote control. This should all get better some day.</p>

      <p>This application is similar to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id547436543">MDX</a> on which I worked before it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Allows to search for high quality travel stories about beautiful places from travel blogs and other sources.
      <li>Finds outdoor adventures, historical sites, city life, kid-friendly activities, beautiful vistas and hidden spots.
      <li>Saves search results to a bucket list so you donâ€™t forget your next destination, and lets you share them with travel buddies.
    </ul>

      <h2>Augmented Fitness</h1>

        <p>Imagine exercise rouine unfolding as a story. In this particular example you could be joined by some Disney characters. 
           This work predates ARKit and hence the approach for the graphics is my own. Ideal for such application, though, would be AR glasses. </p>

        <h2>Multichannel Decoding for Mobile Devices</h1>
          <iframe width="560" height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ankJblpD5xc"></iframe>

          <p>In the days of the 32-bit ARM, this project was aiming to display a handful of video streams simultaneously on a mobile device screen similar to how CCTV stations are used to monitor arrays of security cameras.  Major constraint for this outcome had been the capability of the microprocessor for which the mobile operating systems restricted to one at a time, hence for decoding of single stream only. On this video I experiment with the encoding schemes and container formats for mobile devices. In the aftermath, solution circumventing the ARM limitation was discovered and became the cornerstone for a successful mobile product.</p>
